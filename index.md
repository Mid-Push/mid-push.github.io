Hi! Iâ€™m a fourth year Phd student at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" style="color:#71b07b;">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by [Prof. Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/). I aim to achieve visual intelligence from causal perspectives. Specifically, I focus on **causal representation learning** with multi-domain images, with applications to image-to-image translation, conditional image generation and domain adaptation. I also have a strong passion for **generative models**, e.g., GAN, normalizing flow and diffusion models. 



## News

- **[Feb. 2023]** Two paper are accepted into CVPR2023! The diffusion-based inpainting method-[SmartBrush](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05034.pdf) and a new method for image-to-image translation!
- **[Jan. 2023]** One paper [i-stylegan](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=U2g8OGONA_V) is accepted as ICLR2023 Spotlight! One of the first works to connect identifiability with multidomain image generation.
- **[Dec. 2022]** Check our new [SmartBrush](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05034.pdf) Paper! A diffusion-based object inpainting model that beats Stable Diffusion and DALLE-2!
- **[Nov. 2022]** I am attending the Neurips2022. See you in New Orleans!
