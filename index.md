## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m a fourth year Phd student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Kun Zhang](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/). 

I recieved my bachelor and master degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen), mentored by [Prof. Zibin Zheng](https://www.zibinzheng.com/). I interned at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) with [Zhifei Zhang](https://zzutk.github.io/), [Zhe Lin](https://sites.google.com/site/zhelin625/) and [Tobias Hinz](http://www.tobiashinz.com/) during summer and fall 2022. I was a visiting student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) with [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/). I also work closely with [Prof. Mingming Gong](https://mingming-gong.github.io/). 



## Research Interests
**I aim to achieve visual intelligence from causal perspective.** 
- **Causal Representation Learning with Multidomain Images:** Image Translation, Image Generation, Domain Adaptation
- **Generative Models:** GAN, Normalizing Flow, Diffusion Model
- **Causality:** Causal discovery, Counterfactual Inference

Feel free to contact me if you find any research interests that we might share. I am always open to potential collaborations.

## News

- **[Feb. 2023]** Two paper are accepted into CVPR2023! The diffusion-based inpainting method-[SmartBrush](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05034.pdf) and a new method for image-to-image translation!
- **[Jan. 2023]** One paper [i-stylegan](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=U2g8OGONA_V) is accepted as ICLR2023 Spotlight! One of the first works to connect identifiability with multidomain image generation.
- **[Dec. 2022]** Check our new [SmartBrush](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05034.pdf) Paper! A diffusion-based object inpainting model that beats Stable Diffusion and DALLE-2!
