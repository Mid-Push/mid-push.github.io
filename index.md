Hi! I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Prof. Kun Zhang</a> and <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/people/faculty/spirtes.html" style="color:#1E90FF;">Prof. Peter Spirtes</a>.

I have had the privilege of interning at <a href="https://research.adobe.com/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Adobe Research</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/zhelin625/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Zhe Lin</a>, <a href="https://zzutk.github.io/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Zhifei Zhang</a>, and <a href="https://www.tobiashinz.com/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Tobias Hinz</a>, as well as at <a href="https://research.google/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Google</a> with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/zhao-yang/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Yang Zhao</a>, <a href="https://xavierxiao.github.io/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Zhisheng Xiao</a>, and <a href="https://ckkelvinchan.github.io/" style="color:#1E90FF;">Kelvin C. K. Chan</a>.
Before that, I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zWnsNrkAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Zibin Zheng</a> at <a href="https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/">SYSU</a> and had the opportunity to visit <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/home">Prof. Michael R. Lyu</a> at <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/">CUHK</a>.

My long-term research goal is to develop generative AI systems that go beyond producing realistic multimodal data to capturing the underlying structure of the world. By grounding machine learning and computer vision in principled representations of structure and dependencies, I aim to make generative models not only powerful, but also controllable, interpretable, trustworthy, and capable of systematic generalization.
