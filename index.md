Hi! Iâ€™m a Phd student at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" style="color:#71b07b;">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/" style="color:#71b07b;">Prof. Kun Zhang</a>. I'm interested in machine learning and computer vision from a causal perspective. Specifically, I focus on learning causal representations for controllable generative models.
