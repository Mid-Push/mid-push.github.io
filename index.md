Hi! Iâ€™m a fourth year Phd student at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" style="color:#71b07b;">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kunz1/" style="color:#71b07b;">Prof. Kun Zhang</a>. I aim to achieve visual intelligence from causal perspectives. Specifically, I focus on **causal representation learning** with multi-domain images, with applications to image-to-image translation, conditional image generation and domain adaptation. I also have a strong passion for **generative models**, e.g., GAN, normalizing flow and diffusion models.
